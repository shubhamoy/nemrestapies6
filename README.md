# REST API implementation using NodeJS, Express, and MongoDB using ES6

A simple REST API using Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB. It can act as a boilerplate as well as a guide to the beginners.

## How should I start?
1. Install MongoDB or you can use any Database-as-a-Service provider
2. Clone this repo
3. In your terminal, `npm start`
4. Point your browser to `localhost:3000`

Further you can use any REST Client like Postman or Advanced REST Client for interacting with the API. You would need to make changes in `index.js` on line 11 and add your database connection string.

## API Routes
1. (GET) `/contact`
2. (POST) `/contact`
3. (PUT) `/contact/:contactID`
4. (DELETE) `/contact/:contactID`

## What should I do?
1. Use this as a boilerplate for your new project
2. Report issues
3. See ES6 in Action
4. Spread the word :)
